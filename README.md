# beany-prompt
my zsh prompt, its really quite unimpressive
which is kinda the point, i just want something that works, gives me what i personally find useful, and thats it,
no compiled code or anything, just zsh scripting, not even sure if itll run with plugin managers, but sourcing it works so probably


credits go out to this gist that did most of the work:
https://gist.github.com/knadh/123bca5cfdae8645db750bfb49cb44b0

i also took the cwd snippet from god knows where and really cant remember, probably some stackoverflow post on the basics of zsh prompts
oh and i took the specific glyphs from https://github.com/octarect/clarity.zsh cause i thought it looks nice and reminded mo of some repl i used once and cant remember what it is

frankly i contributed nothing to this, in retrospect its just plain plagiarism so uh... 
if you care that i took your snippet and made it half the prompt, hit me up on twitter @verycoolbean, ill gladly yeet the repo
